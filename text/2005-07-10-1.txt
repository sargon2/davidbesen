title: CSS speculation
Cross-browser web development is difficult -- everyone knows this.  But the real question in my mind is whether or not the W3 guys are solving this with CSS.  As far as I can tell, every version of CSS up until now has had the same problem -- too many cooks.  Engineers love to argue, and when you put too many of them in a small space, it becomes a definite case of spoiled broth.  The times that I've co-authored anything that requires even the tiniest inkling of artistic thought (which includes large-scale application structure design), I find it's better for each engineer to come up with their own from-scratch, ground-up design, then compare them only after they're completed.  Otherwise, each engineer throws his or her ideas into the mix at every step of the way -- "But what if..," "That won't work because..," etc., and you end up with a horrible, unusable conglomeration of ideas.  I think the design industry knows how to deal with these problems, since artists always know that there isn't only one correct way to do things.  All the engineers have to do is not be so completionist about design.  There's no shortcut to longevity.  Because code exists, it will have to be maintained, tweaked, and changed to fit the times.
But hey, at least CSS works better than table design, right?  In my opinion, tables are more consistent, easier to use, and more compatible -- but I can't decide if this is due to their not being as abstract as CSS, or just due to the time frame in which they were created.  When tables were first being used for web design, the web was young.  There wasn't nearly as many people using it or designing for it.  And even back then, using tables for page layout was a hack -- but an acceptable hack, since there was no viable alternative.
Oh well, at least I have my page designed now.
