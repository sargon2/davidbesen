Lately, I've been all too fascinated with Japanese culture and language.  I'm into week 5 of an audio Japanese course, and I'm amazed by both how interesting the language is and by how much of it I'm retaining.  My friend Dave (who is currently living in Japan) will be back soon, so I'll have at least one other person to try speaking Japanese with.  
For a short period of time I was attempting to learn Esperanto (laugh all you want), and as you'd expect Japanese is much more fulfilling to study.  Esperanto obviously doesn't have a culture all its own, and in comparison the Japanese culture is intricately beautiful.  This provides me with all the motivation I need to continue studying the language, and I'm planning to study it formally after I transfer to CSU.
Some of the ways the culture interacts with the language are surprising to me.  Everyone thinks of the Japanese as extremely polite, and they are -- but not always in the way that you would expect.  For example, in order to excuse yourself politely you say "Shitsurei shinakereba naranai n desu".  If I was imagining the most polite way to leave, I'd think of apologizing for it -- not so in Japanese.  The phrase literally translates as "If I don't leave, it won't do".  Maybe this is polite because you're not skirting the issue, I don't know.  Another example is "Dou itashimashite" -- this phrase is generally translated to English as "you're welcome", but in Japanese it means roughly "I didn't do anything worthy of being thanked."  An American would consider politeness of that level annoying to the point of being rude.
Another interesting aspect of Japanese culture is anime.  There are more people who enjoy watching anime in America than there are in Japan (at least in my age group), but I still believe it to be an aspect of Japanese culture instead of American.  After all, the people who create it are Japanese.  Perhaps it says something about the Japanese culture that they're so willing to neatly package and export their culture to other places, but so resistant to outside forces affecting their own culture.  Or maybe it's just economic, I don't know.
If you like anime and haven't seen it yet, I wholeheartedly recommend watching <a href="http://www.animenfo.com/animetitle,1493,hafpby,mai_hime.html">Mai Hime</a>.  Although somewhat childish in appearance (like most anime!), its carefully crafted character development and intriguing plot won me over.  Also, its musical score was composed by Yuki Kajiura (.hack, Noir), whose work I always love.  The music switches back and forth between happily up-spirited and hauntingly dark.  It does have some 3d CG in it, which is usually enough to get me to hate a show (ugh, remember Zoids?), so it really says something that I like Mai Hime despite this.  The parts of the show that aren't thrown-together CG are very pretty.  If you want a preview and don't mind spoilers, look <a href="http://random.xem.us/mai-hime/">here</a> (<a href="http://www.divx.com/divx/play/download/">divx</a> codec required for video).
