title: School status update
I was accepted for readmission to CSU for the Spring 2006 term under "Probation 1" status, meaning I'll have 3 terms to get my cumulative GPA back up above a 2.0.  Apparently I was a complete idiot and misinterpreted the online application as also applying me for the Fresh Start program.  It doesn't, so I have an appointment with their advisors to talk about that Tuesday.  If I'm admitted to that program, I will transfer in with a 4.0 GPA and won't have to worry about the probationary status thing.
My FRCC classes started out well.  My philosophy teacher is awesome, in a "you're-wrong-and-here's-why" sort of way.  Learning from my english teacher is sort of like learning from a football coach (both in auditory volume and motivational paradigm), so I've got my fingers crossed for that one.  Math is, as always, math -- but my teacher made me buy a new calculator since my current one was too smart.
Then there's my digital photography class.  The class is very serious as an extension to the film photography classes.  It has two distinct sides -- first, the technical aspects of digital photography like how to use photoshop, which features of the camera are important, color management, etc., and second, it is a class in developing your photographic vision.  A lot of the students in the class are far better photographers than I, so it will be great to see what they come up with.  The teacher keeps using the phrase "body of work," so I think I'll have to take pictures along a theme that I have yet to come up with.  In the previous (2nd) class that I want to, we formally critiqued the work of some famous portrait photographers who had some quite amazing pieces.
I couldn't be happier.
