title: Yay for photography
I've updated my shoebox (at long last!) with some pics I took today.  This is the first I've shot raw, and I have to say I'm impressed.  I had no idea raw let you get detail out of blown-out highlights, and that it made such a difference in exposure compensation.  <a href="http://davidbesen.com/shoebox/2005-09-10-class">Check it</a>.
