title: Interruptions and the human spirit
# the telephone, tennis doubles, programming, apologize for rant
As I get older, I find that I start to notice little things about myself, little quirks that seem to consistently resurface time and again in seemingly unrelated areas.  One of those is how being interrupted affects my ability to perform.

When I'm working on something, how effectively I make progress in it depends entirely on how much of myself I can throw into it.  It's a well-known fact that people who are truly good at what they do are able to give themselves fully to their work, to completely ignore everything irrelevant to the task at hand.  I find that for myself, I am only capable of doing this effectively if I'm not interrupted.  I'm sure that better people than myself are capable of switching tasks rapidly, without loss of efficiency, but no matter how hard I try I simply can't do it.

Our society is based around interruptions.  The telephone is the primary example of this -- it allows anyone to interrupt whatever anyone else is doing based on nothing but a whim.  With cellphones, this is even more true.  Whether you're driving, deeply involved in a good novel, or even going to the bathroom, you can be interrupted at any time.  Does being interrupted to talk on the phone while you're driving affect your ability to avoid an accident in an emergency situation?  It certainly does for me, and I simply won't answer my phone if I'm driving.  I pull over, then answer it.  
Really.

When I'm working on a project at work, I think my progress is a smooth S-curve which depends on the time since my last interruption.  If I could measure my work in units, I think after I'm interrupted -- even a tiny 1-second interruption! -- in the first 5 minutes I'll do 1 unit of work, then after 10 minutes I have 3 units done, and after an hour I'll have 50 units done.  If I'm interrupted once every 5 minutes, then in that hour I will complete 10 units of work.  This might be too concrete of an example, but you get the idea.  I think if all of my outside interaction was limited to a certain time of day, say the hour directly after lunch, I would accomplish significantly more.

After work almost every day, I play tennis with my friends.  I really enjoy doing this, but as there's 4 of us we almost always play doubles instead of singles.  As a result, the time between when I get to hit the ball is significantly increased.  Some of the time (when I'm the secondary player on the serving team) I can go an entire game without hitting the ball once.  This <i>hugely</i> affects my ability to play well.  The more "flow" I can get going with the ball, the better I do, period.  When I play singles, I can throw myself into the game significantly better than in doubles where I have to hit the ball, wait 30 seconds, hit it, wait, etc.  In singles, I feel like I'm improving significantly faster than when I play doubles, and I enjoy myself significantly more, even if I don't win.

This concept seems to scale well.  If someone talks while I'm serving the tennis ball, I can't serve it in to save my life -- but if they're quiet, then I can hit it in a lot more consistently.  This is a form of tiny interruption, but still significant enough to somehow change the pattern of how my neurons fire.  If people are talking while I'm trying to work, I can't work nearly as effectively.  I put this in the same class as the larger, "hey can you do this" kind of interruptions.

I must apologize for ranting.  I am curious if this whole interruption thing is true or not for other people, but I'm fairly certain that it's true for me.  The real question is what I can do about it.  I would love to be able to do those 50 units of work in an hour despite being interrupted, or to be able to play excellent tennis despite there being a crowd of thousands on center court at Wimbledon.  I just don't know how to proceed.  Maybe if I had a better handle on my thought processes somehow, I could better control them.  

Perhaps this is part of what it means when the Taoist sage says to meditate to calm the mind.  Can you stop thinking long enough to let the dust settle?


# small-scale like ppl talking while I try to serve, to large-scale like doubles, etc
