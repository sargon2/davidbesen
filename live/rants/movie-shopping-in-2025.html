      <p>I want to rewatch Everything Everywhere All at Once (EE), and I like it so much I'd prefer to own it if possible.  I'm signed up to MoviesAnywhere (MA) because I like the idea of it, but I understand not every movie is on it.  I check, and EE is not there.  So I look at JustWatch, and per JustWatch it's on all the exact platforms MA supports -- Amazon, Apple TV, Google Movies, Youtube (which is different from Google Movies for some stupid reason), and Fandango at Home (formerly Vudu).  So it's clearly stored on the same servers as MA movies, they just opted not to allow MA for it because they think it's more profitable not to provide it there.  It's exactly $19.99 on all 5 of those platforms, and indeed movies are always the exact same price on every platform due to obvious price collusions.  Remember from macroeconomics that price collusions can happen in oligopolies even without any communication between actors.</p>
      <p>I'm currently signed up for Netflix for $24.99/month in order to watch parts 1 & 2 of Wednesday season 2.  They have a $7.99/mo plan, which is ad-supported so fuck that, and a $17.99/mo plan, which doesn't support 4K, so I got the highest-level plan with the intention of canceling it after I quickly and inevitably run out of things to watch on it, because everything good leaves Netflix almost immediately.  I search Google for EE on Netflix and find it.  Awesome!  But the page gives absolutely no info and says I must log in.  Fine.  I log in, and only after I log in does Netflix tell me EE is not available there.  The only indication it's not is there's a "Notify Me" button instead of a "Play" button, and no indication of when (if ever) it will become available.  So I can't watch it there even though Netflix made it seem like it was available to non-paying users, Google, and other search robots.</p>
      <p>I could choose a platform to buy it on out of the available platforms.  But Amazon has started showing ads to people who pay for Prime, which is totally unacceptable, so I can't buy it there.  Apple TV only works well on Apple devices, so I can't buy it there.  Google Movies feels redundant with Youtube, and I'm already paying for Youtube Premium in order to avoid interstitial ads there (which doesn't avoid embedded ads; for that I have to install the SponsorBlock extension, which Google will possibly disable in the near future like they disabled ublock.  We'll see).   So, I don't want to buy it on Youtube either because I'm already paying for Youtube to get rid of ads and I don't want to double-pay for it.  I don't want to buy it on Fandango at Home because they recently renamed themselves from Vudu, so I don't trust that Fandango won't simply delete their entire movie library, leaving users stranded.  That seems like tin-hat stuff but there's literally nothing stopping them from doing that, or from simply ceasing support for common smart TVs/devices.</p>
      <p>I could pay to rent it.  But I don't want to do that because it's a good enough movie that I know I'm going to want to watch it more than once, and I don't want to pay to rent it multiple times.</p>
      <p>I could pirate it.  But then my movie library is stored locally only, and I hate that, due to storage costs/maintenance and a lack of cloud backup/availability.  I could pay for a cloud backup/streaming service for my pirated movie library I suppose, but when I did that before it was expensive and janky.  Also I've found recently that pirated copies of movies are garbage quality compared to official -- they'll be in the wrong color space, or won't properly support modern features like HDR, or audio channels will be fucked up and I won't be able to hear the dialog, or their audio dynamic range will be way too high, or they will have bitrate artifacts in dark scenes despite being high-bitrate, or their CC track (which I need due to poor audio quality) will be fucked up and misaligned or outright incorrect.  VLC lets you dynamically adjust audio and CC latency, but who wants to sit there and manage temporal alignments while watching a movie?  Also, and this goes without saying, piracy is illegal and unethical.</p>
      <p>So, I'm out of luck.  I have no good way to watch EE despite truly loving it.  I want to reward its creators, but I have no way to do that without nearly all the money being funneled to grobbley middlemen.  Maybe I'll email the Daniels (who directed it) and ask them if I can pay them directly for it.</p>
