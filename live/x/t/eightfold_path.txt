My summary of the Buddhist Noble Eightfold Path:

1. Care about truth. ("Right view")
2. Care about morality. ("Right intention")
3. Only say something if it is true, beneficial, and timely. ("Right speech")
4. Do not murder, steal, or commit adultery. ("Right action") (some writings also say to be chaste)
5. Do not conduct business in weapons, humans, meat, intoxicants, or poison. ("Right livelihood")
6. "Right Effort"
  1. Make an effort to prevent greed, hatred, and delusion from arising within yourself.
  2. Make an effort to extinguish them if they have arisen.
  3. Make an effort to cultivate generosity, kindness, and wisdom (the opposite of the above).
  4. Make an effort to maintain them if they have arisen.
7. Maintain a calm, detached awareness of your own body and thoughts and what's happening around you.  ("Right mindfulness")
  1. Avoid judgements and interpretations.  If they occur, register and drop them.
8. Meditate by concentrating on an object of attention (such as your breath, a visual object, or mantra) ("Right concentration")
  1. Release all passions, desires, and unwholesome thoughts, so you stop feeling these things. You will feel joy.
  2. Let intellectual activity fade.  It will be replaced by tranquility.
  3. Give up the joy found in (1).  It will be replaced by equanimity (evenness of mind) and great clarity.
  4. Give up the tranquility found in (2) and any suffering you feel.  Give up all joy and sorrow.  You will feel only equanimity.
