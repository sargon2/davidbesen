a place for my own personal rants -- the "weblog" section
[Fri Nov 10 22:33:22 MST 2000] - Site...
At long last, I've decided to make the site live, rather than wait forever while I write the forums, and some actual content... Maybe it's actual existence will provoke me to work on it :p
[Sun Nov 19 11:20:21 MST 2000] - I want Tribes 2!
I spent all morning looking at Tribes 2, and damn does it look good.  I just got back into playing tribes 1.  I had forgotten how much fun that style of gameplay is, and t2 looks so much better.  Huge, intricate landscapes laced with quake-3 style buildings (minus the bulbous aspects), tons of vehicles, weapons, and such to play with.... I hope it happens soon.

Speaking of horrible failures.... oh well, only lost $12 on the venture :)
