sargon's newbie guide to ragnaretiquette

kuy/55555
---------
You'll see a lot of players running around saying either 'kuy' or '55555'.  Rest assured these are _American_ players, as this is the US server and no one else could connect to it with a reasonable ping.  If they don't respond, it's not because they don't understand you; it's because they don't have time to talk to a newbie like you.

Kuy stands for

A player says '55555' when he or she is asking for a handout.  The number they say is how much Zeny they want; you should give it to them in order to earn their respect.

Bots
----
Bots are programs people write to play RO for them.  This is generally smiled upon by the RO community since programming skill is valued and looked up to, and it exposes weaknesses in the basic RO design (gotta keep those developers on their toes!).  If you're a programmer, I wholeheartedly recommend taking a shot at this; not only will you gain levels incredibly quickly, but you'll also gain the respect of all your peers!
