False Positives and False Negatives<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
This has been a subject of heated debate between Bascule and myself for some time in #ro, and I wanted to put my reasons in writing in the hopes of diffusing some of the artillery fire (read: lowering my level of whining).<br>
Any time you have a test which is not perfectly accurate, you have false positives and false negatives to deal with. &nbsp;In most situations you cannot remove all inaccuracy, but you can weight the test to one side or the other.<br>
In deciding which way to weight the test, you must consider many factors. &nbsp;The primary factor is the overall function of the test -- what it's intended to do.<br>
<br>
In law, the goal is to protect honest citizens from criminals. &nbsp;Stated differently, that is to protect people from harm.<br>
Let's pretend for a moment that we weight our law system towards false positives. &nbsp;That is to say, we increase the number of wrongly convicted citizens, and decrease the number of wrongly freed criminals. &nbsp;If the goal of the law system was to put criminals behind bars, then this would be the better option -- it would put more criminals behind bars. &nbsp;<br>
However, since the goal of our law system is not simply to put criminals in jail, we have a problem. &nbsp;Putting someone in jail who has done nothing wrong violates the goal of our system. &nbsp;Instead of protecting him from harm, we have put him in great harm -- he has lost his freedom.<br>
Now notice that each wrongly convicted citizen also leaves a criminal on the street. &nbsp;We don't know that the freed criminal will continue to commit crimes. &nbsp;If he does, then he will eventually be caught -- so now we have one criminal in jail, and one "non-criminal" in jail. &nbsp;If he doesn't, all we have is one criminal on the loose and one "non-criminal" in jail.<br>
Now let's swap positions and pretend that we weight our law system towards false negatives. &nbsp;We increase the number of wrongly freed criminals, and decrease the number of wrongly convicted citizens. &nbsp;Now we're back to those two scenarios -- when we let a criminal go free, we don't know if he will continue to commit crimes or not.<br>
The difference is this time we don't have the "non-criminal" in jail while we're waiting for him to commit another crime. &nbsp;So if the criminal doesn't commit any more crimes, then we have no problem -- no one is in jail wrongly, and no crimes are being committed. &nbsp;If he does commit more crimes, then we will eventually catch him -- and we still have no problem.<br>
Therefore, it would seem that false negatives are significantly better than false positives in the law system. &nbsp;Had we lost sight of the goal of the system, i.e. seen the goal as to simply put criminals in jail, we would have come to the wrong decision.<br>
<br>
In disease detection, the goal is to protect people from disease. &nbsp;If we view the goal as simply to detect disease, then it will seem that false negatives are better than false positives, since for all we know the person we are letting go will overcome the disease on his own, treatment can be very expensive, and a lot of the time the treatment is almost as bad as the disease for someone who doesn't have it.<br>
However, since the goal is not simply to detect disease, we can see that false positives are much better than false negatives -- the diseased person we free will infect others.<br>
Once again, had we lost sight of the goal of the system we would have come to the wrong decision.<br>
<br>
In spam-fighting software, we run into the same problem. &nbsp;If we view the goal as to detect spam, then it would seem false positives are better, since you receive less spam. &nbsp;But the real goal of spam-fighting software is to let the user read their email more easily, and therefore false negatives are far better.<br>
<br>
Now, the real point of this. &nbsp;In urlgrabber, the goal is not to just detect urls! &nbsp;The goal is to make it easier for people who browse with a machine other than they irc with to go to urls. &nbsp;It is significantly easier for them to ignore a false positive than to re-type a false negative in their address bar.<br>
<br>
That's all I have. &nbsp;If some of it doesn't make sense, tell me and I'll expand.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time, and sorry for all the whining.<br>

(p.s. my grabber wgets from feh in 1/40th the time of basc's, 0.015s vs. 0.620s real... this will change if/when I add searching, nick, timestamp, and other features to it -- features which don't sacrifice the goal of the system)<br>
