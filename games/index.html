        <h2>Portal <span class="release-year">(2007)</span></h2>
        <p>Portal is absolutely the best example of starting with a core mechanic and building the game around it.  Even without its stellar theme and personality, the game would be a hit because the core puzzle mechanic is absolutely perfect.  Then, add in the characters and (somewhat deemphasized) plot and it becomes what I consider the best game ever made.  Its blend of immersion, motion, aesthetics, puzzles, and experience is simply unparalleled.</p>

        <h2>Minecraft <span class="release-year">(2011)</span></h2>
        <p>When I was younger, and first getting into seriously programming games, I had the idea to build a game where users could add or remove items, build buildings, and generally modify their world.  I started work on it, but due to other commitments was never able to finish it.  Years after that, Minecraft came out, and it is the best embodiment of that idea for me.  Minecraft is by far the most creative video game I've ever played.  It is meditative and beautiful, and I've gone back to play it for long hours many times over the last decade, both solo and with friends.</p>

        <h2>Factorio <span class="release-year">(2020)</span></h2>
        <p>Factorio is a game about automation.  You do a task such as mining resources, then create a machine to automate doing the task for you.  Then you chain together these machines using conveyor belts and robot arms, automating more and more.  The raw technical achievement of this game is incredible -- the sheer number of automation machines and conveyor belts you can have running at one time, in real time, is simply amazing.  The game's fun, addictive mechanics, combined with its ability to push the boundaries of what's possible in a game, more than earns it a spot on this list.</p>

        <h2>Hollow Knight <span class="release-year">(2017)</span></h2>
        <p>If you're not already aware, there's a game genre called "Metroidvania", which is named for the early Metroid and Castlevania games.  Hollow Knight is the pinnacle of this genre in my opinion.  It is dark, beautiful, engaging, and immersive.  It is quite difficult and combat-oriented, but also at times quiet, calm, and meditative.  When you explore the world of this game, you are rewarded tenfold with gorgeous surroundings and curious oddities.  The value for dollar of this game at $15 is astronomial.</p>

        <h2>Braid <span class="release-year">(2008)</span></h2>
        <p>Braid is a stellar example of building a game around a core idea.  Each level adds a new inventive mechanic around the theme of controlling time.  The puzzles are fun and well-tuned for difficulty without any need for explicit mechanisms for managing flow or difficulty settings.  The art for the game is absolutely top-tier and is much of the reason for the game's commercial success.  Braid is the game I look to when I need a model for how to make a game as a small development team.</p>

        <h2>Half-Life 2 <span class="release-year">(2004)</span></h2>
        <p>Half-Life 2 is an exemplary mix of first-person action, adventure, and heartfelt, engaging story.  It is a definitional game for me -- that is, a game that really defines what gaming is and can be.  Its villain, Dr. Breen, is magnificently intelligent and his motivations are honestly believable.  The worldbuilding, scenery, character development, and voice acting all combine into an experience that will shape you as a gamer and even possibly as a person.  As long as you can see past its 2004 levels of poly counts and texture resolutions, this game is an absolute must-play for any PC gamer and is the game that made Steam a platform.</p>

        <h2>Plants vs. Zombies <span class="release-year">(2009)</span></h2>
        <p>Before EA ruined it with microtransactions, PvZ was the best embodiment of a tower defense game.  Its perfectly tuned difficulty curve, cute and engaging graphics and sounds, and healthy mixture of core gameplay with variety makes it an addictive classic.  The best version to play is probably the Game of the Year edition on Steam.</p>

        <h2>The Talos Principle <span class="release-year">(2014)</span></h2>
        <p>The Talos Principle's genre can only be described as "philosophical puzzle game".  It is contemplative, emphasizes tradition and belief, and mixes in dynamic puzzle gameplay in beautiful settings that show various cultures in various stages of decay.  Its musical score is wandring, mystical, and curious, and I've listened to it on its own even outside of the game.  The game includes nostalgic old-style green text terminals, which allow you to explore the concepts and philosophies of the game through reconstructing an old text library of knowledge.  This is the only game that has given me cause, space, and time to reconsider and contemplate my own actual core beliefs.</p>

        <h2>Star Control II <span class="release-year">(1992)</span></h2>
        <p>Star Control II built on the inventive melee combat of Star Control 1, adding a plot, plenty of character interactions, a gigantic starmap, and 3d renders of spinning planets.  It's hard for me to separate the actual quality of the game from the high level of nostalgia I have for it, but this game makes it into my hall of fame because of its inventive variety of races to interact with and surprising depth of combat.  It was truly the first open-world (really open-universe) game that I played, and I felt the freedom of being able to go anywhere.  To 10-year-old me, it was a true adventure among the stars.</p>

        <h2>Super Mario Bros. 3 <span class="release-year">(1988)</span></h2>
        <p>Super Mario Bros. 3 marks a change in the gaming industry for me.  Before this game, games were all about programmers and video game teams experimenting and striving to do what they thought would be best and most fun.  But SMB3 is different.  Rather than striving to be fun by showing the player something more extreme, difficult, or surprising than before, SMB3 builds on its traditional heritage, learns from mistakes of the past (Japanese SMB2 was too hard, and US SMB2 was simply a re-skin), and focuses more on having a consistent visual theme and music good enough to stand on its own merit even without the game.  It provides the player the right level of challenge, allowing the player to adjust their own difficulty in subtle ways, without explicitly having a difficulty setting.  This is the first spark of the idea of flow in video games, and it's spectacular.</p>

      <div class="game-info">
        <h2>Super Mario World <span class="release-year">(1990)</span></h2>
        <p>Super Mario World, on it surface, seems like a logical progression of the Mario series, which own its own would be fun and worth investing in, but not hall-of-fame worthy.  But Super Mario World's design is deceptively complex.  The addition of the switch palaces allows the player to directly control the difficulty of the game, indicating the game's focus on flow, but then the game adds in the cape, haphazardly allowing Mario to fly over entire levels.  The idea that a game could simply break the parameters of flow, saying to the player "Sure, you can skip the whole level, why not?", boosts the player's curiosity and engagement tremendously.  The first time you skip a level using the cape, you think "Well! That was fun. But what did I miss?" and you go back and play it again.  It indicates the game's confidence in how fun its level designs are, that players will go back and play them just to see them even if they aren't required to to progress.  Plus you get to ride a dinosaur.</p>

        <h2>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare <span class="release-year">(2007)</span></h2>
        <p>I'm not usually a fan of war simulators, but this one in particular is interesting for the wide variety of different scenarios it puts you in.  You can experience everything from being a camouflaged sniper mere feet from the enemy to avoiding radiation in the Chernobyl exclusion zone.  It was clearly made with care and precision, and if you have any interest at all in fighting simulators, this one (really the remastered version)should be on your bucket list.</p>
