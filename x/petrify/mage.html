The best strategy for a mage is just that -- to have a strategy, and to stick to it as you develop.<BR>
<BR>
A. Skills<BR>
---------------------------<BR>
There are several lines a mage can choose between.<BR>
<BR>
I. SOUL STRIKE MAGES<BR>
The soul strike mage can do a lot of damage very fast.  The problem is SP cost.  For that reason, SP recovery is essential for reasonable leveling speed.<BR>
I recommend:<BR>
1. Put one point in SP recovery.  When you allocate your first point, you won't be doing enough damage to kill things with spells (even if you have an earring/arcwand).<BR>
2. Raise Napalm Beat to 4<BR>
3. Get Soul Strike 1<BR>
4. Raise SP recovery to 3 (by now you should be doing enough damage to level off of just napalm beat)<BR>
5. Soul Strike 3<BR>
6. SP Recovery 5<BR>
7. Soul Strike 5<BR>
8. SP Recovery 7<BR>
7. Soul Strike 7<BR>
9. SP Recovery 9 or 10<BR>
10. Soul Strike 9 or 10<BR>
11. Raise Napalm beat to 7 or 10 (at level 10 it does 2*MATK)<BR>
--<BR>
At this point, you should have enough of an idea of what you want to do to know what to put your points in.  You could max a bolt and become a hybrid mage, or go for Safety Wall (a lot of controversy over that spell, see Misc)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
II. ELEMENTAL MAGES<BR>
The elemental mage can do a lot of damage rather slowly.  For this reason, they can't even go in aggressive areas until later levels; however, they will probably level faster in the non-aggressive areas than the soul strike mages.  The ability to do 10*MATK damage (for only 30 sp), even slowly, is nothing to laugh at.  It is the most efficient SP:Damage ratio of any spell.<BR>
<BR>
IIa. Cold Bolt<BR>
With Cold Bolt comes Frost Driver -- this is very powerful IF combined with Lightning Bolt.  Many a mage has killed the doppleganger using this combination.  If frozen, an enemy takes twice the damage from lightning.  I've heard that Frost Driver's success rate is based on your level, but I haven't confirmed that.  When you advance it in levels, the time the enemy stays frozen gets longer.<BR>
<BR>
IIb. Fire Bolt<BR>
With Fire Bolt comes Fire Ball and Fire Wall.  I know next to nothing about either of these spells.  I've heard Fire Ball works better than Napalm Beat for splash, but I haven't confirmed it.<BR>
<BR>
IIc. Lightning Bolt<BR>
With Lightning Bolt comes Thunder Storm.  Thunder Storm can do up to 10*MATK to an area rather than a single monster.  I've only seen it at level 1.  Don't get it if you have high lag -- it's rather hard to aim.  Lightning Bolt is also needed for the Frost Driver combo.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
III. HYBRID MAGES<BR>
The possibilities are endless -- one of my personal favorites is having max Soul Strike, and a bolt to max.  Then you can get either efficient SP use or fast damage.  The only danger is spreading yourself too thin -- 4 level 10 spells is far superior to 10 level 4 spells.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IV. MISC<BR>
IVa. Stone Curse<BR>
Stone Curse is a parlor trick, nothing more.  Its requirement of a red gem renders it rather useless. I use it sometimes to get aggro monsters off of me if more than 1 attack, but that's about it.<BR>
<BR>
IVb. Safety Wall<BR>
Safety Wall requires a blue gem and takes a long time to cast.  I've never seen it successfully used to ward off enemies while you're playing solo.  However, in a group it can be essential.  Just cast it on your party tanker -- suddenly you can go a lot longer without needing potions or rest.<BR>
<BR>
IVc. Sight<BR>
Sight's only use is un-hiding hidden thieves.  Unless you have a fascination with this for some reason, only get it if you intend to get Fire Wall.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
B. Stats<BR>
---------------------------<BR>
There's not much to say about stats other than int, int, int.  If you want to be able to take aggressive monsters, you also need AGI, but that is still secondary to int.<BR>
The reason AGI is important is that when a monster hits you, your spell is interrupted.  If your AGI is higher, you get hit less, and can cast more spells in less time.<BR>
Here's my "ideal" stats setup from the beginning on:<BR>
STR 1 -- there's no reason for a mage to have str.  None.<BR>
AGI 9 -- this is secondary to int<BR>
VIT 9 -- VIT is more important than DEX because later on you won't be hitting anything, and dex is useless.<BR>
INT 9 -- duh<BR>
DEX 1 -- see vit<BR>
LUK 1 -- Perhaps with the new Lucky Dodge implemented, LUK would have some use, but I believe AGI is far more important anyway.<BR>
<BR>
A lot of people say raise INT to 70, then work on AGI.  The reason for this is you get a bonus to both min and max ATK at 70 -- it will be 170 - 266. I personally believe in this strategy; however, if you want to be able to take aggro areas before then, you could raise AGI along with int -- say, keep AGI at 1/2 or 1/4 of your INT.<BR>
<a href="http://www.petrify.net/int.html">here</a>'s a table of INT, min MATK, max MATK, when you get bonuses, damage range, and average damage.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
C. Items<BR>
---------------------------<BR>
Since INT is more important than anything else for a mage, the items that help with that are essential.  Get an arc-wand as soon as possible, then of course an earring (or two, multiple accessories aren't available at the time of this writing)<BR>
DEF doesn't matter too much... my DEF is 16 + 9, and I'm happy with it.  The AGI helps more than the DEF ever will.<BR>
MDEF is easy -- since you're putting so much into INT, your mdef goes up rather quickly.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
D. Location<BR>
---------------------------<BR>
Where you decide to level is obviously essential to efficient level gain.  Unfortunately, the best places for each level change constantly with the flow of the game, how many users are on, and many other factors.  I recommend downloading your favorite <a href="http://www.suppleninja.net/~guantes/">EXP calculator</a> to figure out how much EXP per minute you get in each location.<BR>
