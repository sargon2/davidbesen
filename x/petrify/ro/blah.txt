I am a novice.
  What does this button do?
  Hey, I killed a poring.
  Wow, lunatics are hard.  I hope I didn't die permanently.
  Cool, a new sword.
  Oh, pecopecos link.
  Monsters are scary because I die.
  Neat, red potions heal a lot.

I am a magician.
  I wonder if my magic will ever be stronger than my normal attacks.
  Wow I killed a pecopeco.
  Oh, I see, I have to know the elements.
  Is this spell worth it?
  I've killed a lot of monsters.
  Where should I level?
  Ow, lag hurts.
  Wow, I've killed a lot of monsters.
  This game is fun.

I am a wizard.
  What is the damage formula for this?
  Hey, I wonder if I could take that monster.
  I wish I had gotten different skills.
  Amazing, this new monster gave me 0.3%.
  I can't believe I just said "o.O".
  It takes me forever to regen. :(
  I wish I had been a different class.
  Wow, my heal clip gives me 5 reds for 13 sp.
  Amazing, this new monster gave me 0.1%.
  I wonder if I could...

I am still a wizard.
  I have two thousand sp, and I regen six per second.
  I do tens of thousands of damage, and I mvp bosses in my sleep.
  But sometimes when I walk by a lunatic, I cast soul strike on it
  just to see it fail, and remember a day
  when a lunatic killed me.
