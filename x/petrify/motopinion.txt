Airframe: WattAge Crazy 8; 270sq.in; 32.3oz; 17.2oz/sq.ft; Cd=0.041; Cl=0.08; Clopt=0.43; Clmax=0.98.
Stats: 166 W/lb in; 138 W/lb out; 24mph stall; 36mph opt @ 65% (19:28); 83mph level @ 101% (12:31); 2030ft/min @ 40.4°; -472ft/min @ -8.7°.

Power System Notes:

The full-throttle motor current at the best lift-to-drag ratio airspeed (41.2A) falls between the motor's maximum efficiency current (23.6A) and its current at maximum output (182.7A), thus making effective use of the motor.

Aerodynamic Notes:

The static pitch speed (60mph) is within the range of approximately 2.5 to 3 times the model's stall speed (24mph), which is considered ideal for good performance.
With a wing loading of 17.2oz/sq.ft, a model of this size will have flying characteristics suited to the intermediate pilot, for use in calm to moderate wind conditions.
The static thrust (39.4oz) to weight (32.3oz) ratio is 1.22:1, which will result in extremely short take-off runs, no difficulty taking off from grass surfaces (assuming sufficiently large wheels), and vertical climb-outs. This model will probably be able to perform a hover or torque roll.
At the best lift-to-drag ratio airspeed, the excess-thrust (21.2oz) to weight (32.3oz) ratio is 0.66:1, which will give steep climbs and excellent acceleration. This model should be able to do consecutive loops, and has sufficient in-flight thrust for almost any aerobatic maneuver.

General Notes:

This analysis is based on calculations that take motor heating effects into account.
