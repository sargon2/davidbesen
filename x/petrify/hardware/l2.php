The Toshiba Libretto L2.  One of the smallest fully-functional laptops in existence to date.  
Check it out at <a href=http://www.dynamism.com/libretto/>Dynamism</a>.<br>
I purchased mine second-hand from a <a href="mailto:agarius@hitel.net">Mr. Hyun C. Kim</a> in Seoul, Korea.  If you want to buy one, go through him -- it's like $1100 cheaper than Dynamism, and he gives you everything Dynamism does.<br>
I bought the L2, plus 256MB of ram, plus 30GB hdd for a grand total of $1865.<br>
I'm currently dual-booting <a href="/hardware/l2windows.php">Windows 2000</a> and SGI's XFS version of RedHat <a href="/hardware/l2linux.php">Linux</a> on it.<br>
One of the things that surprised me, and really woke me up to the power of this little machine, is that it's Savage IX video will run Quake 3 in 1280x600 at 30 frames per second.  Amazing.<br>
<br>
Update: I'd like to sell the libretto for around $1200.<br><br>
