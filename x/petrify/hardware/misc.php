AMD K6 233 with a Voodoo3 PCI<br>
$25 P-75 as an IRCterm<br>
Celeron 600 80GB as a little storage server (with a 1024x768 lcd)<br>
A complete 802.11b wireless network<br>
Half of a 1024x768 projector (Bigscreen!)<br>

All of these machines are running various operating systems, mainly Windows 2000 or some flavor of Linux.  I'm only listing currently active hardware.
