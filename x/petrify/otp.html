I am, naturally, fascinated by your claim of unbreakable encryption.  Cryptanalysis is one of my hobbies, and if you have time, I'd like to ask a couple of technical questions about how you achieve this.

1. How do you achieve a perfect random stream using only a computer?  If you say you measure the time between system calls or something like that, I can explain how that is not secure enough for OTP.
2. One-time-pad encryption requires that both parties have the same random key.  How do you transfer the key(s) without compromising your perfect security?

If you have reasonable answers to these questions, I will be interested in purchasing a licence, applying for a job with you, giving you gift money, etc.  I have searched for decades for a way to accomplish what you claim.

Thank you for your time,
