When I'm feeling lazy, and don't want to do any real coding, I make IRC bots (in Perl) to perform specific functions.  The IRC channel I usually hang out in is rather private, i.e. not on a big network, so my work doesn't get used too much... but I find it useful, or in some cases even fun.  Use the links on the left.
