The tournament engine is something I wrote a couple years ago for <a href=http://www.ramcon.org>ramcon</a>.  For the next ramcon, it will be bigger and better.  Its intended purpose is to automatically manage gaming tournaments.  The next version will even start the game servers and automatically record scores.  Hopefully it'll be useful.  Here's the <a href=/projects/tourney/>code</a> for the last version.
<br><br>Update: The "next" ramcon has passed, and I did nothing towards this project. Oh well.<br>
