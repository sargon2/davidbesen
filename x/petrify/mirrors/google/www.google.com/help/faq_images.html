        <p>Google's Image Search is the most comprehensive on the Web, with more 
          than 330 million images indexed and available for viewing. To use Image 
          Search, select the &quot;images&quot; tab or visit <a href="http://images.google.com">http://images.google.com.</a> 
          Enter a query in the image search box, then click on the &quot;Search&quot; 
          button. On the results page, just click the thumbnail to see a larger 
          version of the image, as well as the web page on which the image is 
          located. </p>
        <p>The images identified by the Google Image Search service may be protected

          other than viewing them on the web. Accordingly, if you would like to

        <p><b>WARNING:</b> The results you see with this feature may contain mature 
          content. Google considers a number of factors when determining whether 
          an image is relevant to your search request. Because these methods are 
          not entirely foolproof, it's possible some inappropriate pictures may 
          be included among the images you see. (The mature content filter is 
          only available from an English interface.)</p>

        <p><a name="frame"></a><b>Why does Google show the image in a frame?</b></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>The top frame enables the user to see a slightly larger version of 
            the thumbnail result and provides the image URL. Clicking the image 
            in the top frame links to the actual .jpg or .gif file.</p>
          The bottom frame displays the image in its original context.</blockquote>
        <p><a name="use"></a><b>How do I use image search?</b></p>
        <blockquote> To use image search, simply type your query in the image 
          search box and click the &quot;Search&quot; button or hit &quot;Enter&quot; 
          on your keyboard. When you see the results page, click on the thumbnail 
          version of the picture you want to view. This displays a larger version 
          of the image, as well as the page on which the original image is located. 
        </blockquote>
        <p><a name="mature"></a><b>How do I prevent seeing inappropriate mature content?</b></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Google's Image Search defaults to using an mature content filter 
            on your initial search. The filter removes many adult images but it 
            can't guarantee that all such content will be filtered out. To turn 
            off this filter, click on the link that says &quot;mature content 
            filter is on&quot;. (The mature content filter is only available from 
            an English interface.)</p>
          <p>There is no way to ensure with 100% accuracy that all mature content 
            will be removed from image search results using filters.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><a name="languages"></a><b>Does Google's mature content filter work in all languages?</b></p>
        <blockquote> No, the mature content filter is only available from an English 
          interface.</blockquote>
        <p><a name="off"></a><b>How do I turn the mature content filter off?</b></p>
        <blockquote> Underneath the image search box on the search results page, 
          there is a link to turn off the mature content filter. By clicking on 
          it, users can toggle the filter on and off. Once the mature content 
          filter is turned off, it stays off for the rest of the session and will 
          remain off on the next visit to Google's Image Search. </blockquote>
        <p><a name="how"></a><b>How does image search work?</b></p>
        <blockquote> Google analyzes the text on the page adjacent to the image, 
          the image caption and dozens of other factors to determine the image 
          content. Google also uses sophisticated algorithms to remove duplicates 
          and ensure that the highest quality images are presented first in your 
          results. </blockquote>
        <p><a name="remove"></a><b>How do I remove a copyrighted image that I don't want displayed?</b></p>
        <blockquote> To remove a copyrighted image from Google's Image Search, 
          please visit our <a href="../remove.html#images">Remove Content</a> 
          page. Here you will find instructions on what to do or how to contact 
          us regarding copyrighted images that need to be removed.</blockquote>
        <p><a name="filetype"></a><b>How do I search for images with a specific filetype extension?</b></p>
        <blockquote> From the advanced search box, you can specify the filetype 
          extension by using the operator filetype: in your query. For example, 
          if you wish to see images of flowers that are in .jpg format, then enter 
          [ flower filetype:jpg ] in the search box. </blockquote>
        <p><a name="why"></a><b>An image I know is online wasn't found when I did my search. Why?</b></p>
        <blockquote> You can search more than 330 million images on the Web with 
          Google's Image Search. However, there are many more images on the Internet 
          that Google has not yet added to its index. Google is working to crawl 
          more images to increase the quality and quantity of images returned 
          when you search, so it's likely we will add the image you're looking 
          for in the near future. </blockquote>
        <p><a name="specific"></a><b>Can I search for images of a specific size 
          or type?</b></p>
        <blockquote> Yes. Use the <a href="../advanced_image_search?hl=en">Advanced 
          Image Search</a> page to refine your search. Options include size ranges, 
          coloration, filetypes and more.</blockquote>
        <p><a name="complex"></a><b>Can I do complex searches with image search using Boolean operators 
          and other Google commands?</b></p>
        <blockquote> You can use all operators for image search that you would 
          use in a Google text search. For example, you can use &quot;site:&quot; 
          with image search to restrict your search to images on a particular 
          website. So, to find all the pictures of lemurs at the Duke Primate 
          Center, the query would be &quot; site:duke.edu lemurs&quot;. You can 
          also refine your search using the <a href="../advanced_image_search?hl=en">Advanced 
          Image Search</a> page.</blockquote>
