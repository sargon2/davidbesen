<title>My heart</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Around April of 2006, I started experiencing heart palpitations.  I went in to the doctor, and he told me to get more exercise.  So I did (I took up cycling more seriously).  My resting heart rate fell to about 40-45 bpm.</p>

<p>On 11/18/08, I experienced an unusually strong palpitation.  I felt like I was almost blacking out, and my heart rate was really high.  I took an ambulance to PVH, where they ran blood tests.  They found nothing, and sent me home with a King of Hearts heart monitor.</p>

<p>As part of the followup for that, I went in to see a cardiologist.  He said he thought I just had a normal palpitation and hyperventilated, causing my other symptoms.  He also scheduled me for an echocardiogram to check for "extra tissue" that is apparently common in people my age, and can cause irregular heartbeats.</p>

<p>12/19/08: My echo shows this:</p>

<br />
<p>A 3cm mass in my left atrium.  The cardiologist says he thinks it might be a myxoma, which is a benign tumor.  Pieces of it could break off and cause stroke or sudden death.  I need open-heart surgery to remove it.</p>

<p>12/22/08: I get a TEE (another kind of echocardiogram), which still shows the mass consistent with a myxoma.  The surgeon recommends against using the da Vinci robot to do the surgery, since it will keep me under longer.  He wants to just open my breastplate and get it out that way.  Here's a video from the TEE showing the tumor bouncing off my mitral valve:</p>

Update 12/26/08: I got a ton more tests (CT scan, x-rays, more ultrasounds, blood tests, respiration tests, ABG, etc).  I go into surgery Monday 12/29/08 at 1:30pm at Boulder Community Hospital.
<br />
<br />
Update 1/4/09: I'm still alive.  I have tons of media to upload, including disgusting pics of the thing.
<br />
<br />
Update 1/7/09: So three days after the surgery, I went into rapid atrial fibrillation.  My heart rate was about 200 bpm.  They gave me medication for it, which didn't work, so they tried different medication, which eventually worked.  I was in it for about 7 hours.<br />
People say that it's like running a marathon, but it's really not.  When you're running a marathon, your heartbeat is steady; in AF, it's just random.
<br />
Yesterday morning (1/6) I went back into AF, and went to the emergency room.  They got me out of it, and did an echocardiogram, which showed some fluid around my heart.  I go back in tomorrow to have that looked at again.<br />
I guess 30% of cardiac surgery patients go into AF, and it's just part of the recovery.<br />
<br />
<br />
1/14/09: Still recovering.  My pericardial effusion is draining, and my resting heart rate is dropping back to normal levels.  On the down side, I've been in and out of AF.  The doctors are changing my meds around to try to keep me out of it; apparently if I spend too much time in it, the electrical pathways across my heart change, and I become more likely to go into it.<br />
<br />
Here's the pic of the myxoma:<br />

This thing would have killed me.  Listen to your body!
<br />
<br />
<br />
2/11/09: I'm doing well.  My atrial fibrillation has pretty much completely stopped.  My bones have mended to the point that I can open doors, drive, etc.  I had some complications with my incision, so I'm on antibiotics, but it's healing fine now.  I'll probably be back to work next week.
<br />
<br />
Interesting facts:<br />
 - I lost about 13 pounds from the surgery<br />
 - I was on the heart/lung machine, so they deflated my lungs.  My heart was stopped for 37 minutes<br />
 - The pathology report confirmed 100% that the tumor was an "atrial myxoma - left"<br />
 - 99% of people who have this kind of surgery don't remember anything from the day of surgery.  I remember being positioned on the surgery table, and seeing the big surgery lights<br />
 - I got poked about a thousand times.  My favorite shots were insulin -- very little pain.  The worst were the heparin shots, which I got every 4 hours (including at night).  They feel like acid going in, and leave big ugly blue marks wherever you get one.  My stomach is polka dotted with them.<br />
 - Before the surgery, my fingernail beds were blue.  This is called cyanosis, and is a symptom of hypoxia (not enough oxygen).  I had assumed that they were blue just from being cold all the time, but immediately after the surgery they turned a nice healthy pink.<br />
- They didn't let me shave in the hospital, so I grew a beard:<br />
